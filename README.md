# javascript-algorithms
A set of Javascript algorithms and data structure examples.


## How to run them


1 - `node [filename]`

1.1 - Use `babel-cli` to re-compile if needed

## Disclaimer: you can find some of the code of this repo on Loiane Groner`s book about Data Structure and Algorithms in Javascript (Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms - Third Edition).

### So Gustavo, why are you *copying* them?

After many negative reviews about the book (you can see them on Amazon), I`ve decided to buy the book and test all code examples on the book by myself.

To be very honest with you, so far all examples are working as expected. 

You need, however, to make few adjustments (e.g. using Babel when you get an error when running on nodejs), altough these adjustments were explained on chapter 2. 

That being said, I did some adjustments and decided to put in my own repo, for studying purposes only. The intention here is not to get a coin of Loiane`s work neither plagiarism. These examples are for my personal studies only.

Oh, and the book is awesome. You should definitely buy it.
